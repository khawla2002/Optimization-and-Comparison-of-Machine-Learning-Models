Exploratory Data Analysis and Classification Model Evaluation
Project Overview
This project encompasses exploratory data analysis (EDA) and the evaluation of classification models on a random dataset.
By applying various classification and ML algorithms to the random dataset, We can evaluate and compare the performance of different machine learning models 
in a controlled environment. This helps in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm and selecting the most appropriate one for real-world applications.
The goal for now is to analyze the dataset's characteristics, split the data for machine learning (ML) algorithm application, and assess various 
classification models' performance.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA phase involved several steps:
Dataset Splitting: Although the dataset was already split into official test and training data, the official training data was further divided into train and test sets for
ML algorithm application.
Correlation Analysis: A heatmap was used to visualize the correlation structure among variables, providing insights into potential relationships.
Data Distribution Examination: Histograms and density plots were employed to analyze the distribution of data, facilitating understanding of data characteristics.
Classification Model Building and Evaluation

Several classification models were built and evaluated:
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest
Decision Tree
Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Model evaluation involved assessing each model's accuracy and performance. Techniques such as GridSearch Parameter Tuning were applied to enhance model accuracy.

Model Performance
Among the evaluated models, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) demonstrated the highest accuracy, correctly classifying 82% of test set samples. This highlights its effectiveness in classifying data in this context.

Observations
Resilience to Overfitting: The models exhibited resilience to overfitting, as indicated by the close test data score to the training set and reasonable training times.
This suggests that the models generalize well to unseen data.
Efficient Training Time: Among all models, the training time was shortest for this dataset, indicating efficiency in model training.

Conclusion
The project successfully conducted EDA, dataset splitting, and classification model evaluation on pre-split official test and training data.
K-Nearest Neighbors emerged as the most accurate classifier, showcasing its effectiveness in this classification task. 
The models demonstrated resilience to overfitting and efficient training times, underscoring their potential for real-world applications.
